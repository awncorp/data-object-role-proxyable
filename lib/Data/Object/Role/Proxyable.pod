=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package provides a wrapper around the C<AUTOLOAD> routine which processes
calls to routines which don't exist. Adding a C<build_proxy> method to the
consuming class acts as a hook into routine dispatching, which processes calls
to routines which don't exist. The C<build_proxy> routine is called as a method
and receives C<$self>, C<$package>, C<$method>, and any arguments passed to the
method as a list of arguments, e.g. C<@args>. The C<build_proxy> method must
return a routine (i.e. a callback) or the undefined value which results in a
"method missing" error.
